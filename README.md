# efalg-plagiarism-detector
A very simple plagiarism detector for Java source code which I wrote for my efficient algorithms (efalg) class at [University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland](https://www.fhnw.ch).

## Usage
The program reads every '.java' file in a folder named 'input' and calculates pairwise similarities for all of them.
